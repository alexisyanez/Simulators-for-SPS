# Simulators-for-SPS

May 21st, Coding Update:
The coding has been enhanced using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), making it easier to extend. Everyone is welcome to utilize the new developed simulator for SPS evaluation. Please access it in the folder "OOP_for_SPS".

---------------------------------
This is a simulator for semi-persistent scheduling in C-V2X Mode 4.
Default parameter settings are based on the standard for 20Hz beacon broadcasting. 
The transmit power, beacon range, beacon rate, Reselection Counter range, accessible resource ratio (related to sensing range) can be modified in the simulations.py file.
